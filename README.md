# centraltendency
Here are tried to make the best meausure of central tendency. I created this program because sometimes using only the mean, median and mode will lead to inaccuarate results. This program uses all mean, median and mode to create a better measure of central tendency. 

How to use:
1. Enter how many numbers are in the dataset.
2. Put in each number in the dataset. Click enter after each number.(numbers with decimal does not work which is something to fix)
3. You will then be presented will a list which is the data that you inputed. Then there is the mean, median and mode of the your data. The number at the bottom is what I think a better measure of central tedency.

Hope you enjoy!
